Recipe Book Web Application

This project builds on an earlier project of mine (see Weekly-Dinner-Planner on my github) that reduces the
hassle of deciding what's for dinner every night. The WeeklyDinnersApp will ultimately use the
Weekly-Dinner-Planner's function of displaying a series of randomly selected recipes from the recipebook,
and allow the user to select however many recipes are required, producing a shopping list and storing the 
selected recipes in its own interface for easy access.
At present, the WeeklyDinnersApp is a simple CRUD app that displays the contents of the recipebook database in a
table, showing the name of the recipe, the ingredients list, and the instructions. There is functionality for
creation of a new recipe, updating an existing recipe, and deletion of an existing recipe.
